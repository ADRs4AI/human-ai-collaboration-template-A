# Quick Start Card

**Streamlined Human-AI Collaboration System v3.0**

---

## 30-Second Overview

This system preserves valuable conversations by turning them into persistent artifacts.

**You**: Dump thoughts naturally → **Claude**: Adds structure → **Together**: Make decisions that persist

---

## Essential Files (3)

1. **CLAUDE.md** (87 lines) - Claude reads this at session start
2. **seed-template.md** (12 lines) - For brain dumps
3. **collab-adr-lean.md** (~120 lines) - For decisions

---

## The Workflow (5 steps)

```
1. Dump → Create seed-[topic].md with all your thoughts
2. Tell → "Claude, chunk this into ADRs"
3. Answer → Fill in ANS: blocks naturally
4. Decide → Claude documents with rationale
5. Persist → Decisions in version control
```

---

## Navigation Codes (6 codes)

Find anything instantly:
```bash
QST:  # Questions     → grep '^### QST:' docs/adr/
ANS:  # Answers       → grep 'ANS:' docs/adr/
COD:  # Code examples → grep '^### COD:' docs/adr/
API:  # API calls     → grep '^### API:' docs/adr/
FIL:  # Files         → grep '^### FIL:' docs/adr/
DOC:  # Documentation → grep '^### DOC:' docs/adr/
```

## When to Use What

| Have... | Use... |
|---------|--------|
| Messy thoughts | seed-template.md |
| Complex decision | collab-adr-lean.md |
| Simple decision | template.md (MADR) |
| Quick question | Just ask (escalate if needed) |

---

## Customize CLAUDE.md

Replace these sections:
```markdown
### What we're building:
[Your project description]

### Current focus:
[What you're working on now]

### Key decisions made:
- [Decision 1] - See docs/adr/0001-*.md
```

## Success Check

✅ Important decisions don't disappear
✅ New AI instances continue seamlessly  
✅ Find past decisions in <10 seconds
✅ Process feels helpful, not burdensome

---

## First Session
